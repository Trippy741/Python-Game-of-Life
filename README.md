# Python Game of Life
 The "Game of Life" recreated in Python by me with some extra features.

- Press "F" to pause and use your left mouse button to paint over the dead cells!
- Press "H" to "Kill" all the cells.
- Press "R" to restart the simulation.

#NOTE: Some features may only be accessed while the simulation is paused.
